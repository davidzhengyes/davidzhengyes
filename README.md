**Python enthusiast, chess enjoyer, so I thought, why not create a utility with python for chess?**
<br>
Started out as just an interest, what could I do to enhance my interest in chess? Initially, I wanted to get more familiar with the chess notations, being able to quickly recognize a chess square by its rank and file. This eventually transposed into a curiosity about how machines could interact with chess, such as a notation that could be easily read by computers. I decided to write a program in python that produced a FEN string that a computer could understand using image processing. Looking back on it, there was a lot of terrible code. I improved it in https://github.com/davidzhengyes/ChessFENAgain/. I feel like it is necessary to add, as an .exe of Stockfish, an open-source chess engine, is integrated within that project, that you should NEVER cheat in chess. Really defeats the purpose of learning this delicate game. Although I used to be much better, in terms of chess rating, I still enjoy playing online, and I hope that it is not plagued with cheaters. This project is for AN INTEREST ONLY, with challenges in terms of optimization and features. (If you cheat you are the scum of the earth).

Wrote in Processing. The biggest challenge was the amount of vector math needed (A LOT). I did enjoy it though, and I finally got it working after some time, so that everything works as intended with user input.

Tkinter enjoyers :D

## Still Learning:
Web Development: HTML, CSS, React, JS
<br>
Getting better with these.

## Potential Future Projects:
Youtube helper
<br>
Bluetooth calling app
<br> I know I have more, but I'll add these ideas when they come back

## Need a huge refresher
C++ I haven't used in a long time, didn't really find as practical as Python
<br>
Java? Python supremacy. I used Processing quite thoroughly though, which is based on Java.
